# CoE199_SSL12_Velasco

This repository contains a full stack application structured into multiple components: backend server, database scripts, frontend application, and optional blockchain integration.

## Overview

The project includes the following parts:

- **Backend Server**  
  Located in the `api/` folder. This contains the APIs and database configurations. You can explore the source code to understand how routes, services, and business logic are implemented.

- **Database**  
  SQL scripts for creating database tables and stored procedures are available in the `Database/` folder. These define the data structure and encapsulate key operations for efficiency and reusability.

- **Frontend Application**  
  The `frontend/` folder contains the admin and teacher side codes for the user interface. It communicates with the backend and presents the application to end users.

- **Blockchain**  
  The `blockchain/` folder contains smart contract used in this implementation. For detailed instructions, refer to this step-by-step guide:

  You are free to customize the network based on your own needs.

## Notes

- This repository does not include setup scripts or detailed instructions, assuming you are reviewing or reusing the code in your own development environment.
